# DeviceFarmUploader
Command line tool written in C# that uses Amazon's Device Farm API to upload and manage tests

I wrote this tool to help with test automation using Device Farm, before moving on to other projects. I am making it freely available because it might be useful to somebody else, but I haven't spent a lot of time or efforts to make it totally configurable or functional. The tool met my specific needs for the project I was on, so please bear that in mind. 

I used a lot with Android, and not so much with iOS. However, it shouldn't be hard to make it work with both of them if necessary (for example, some of the command line options uses the work "APK", instead of a more generic term).
